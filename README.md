# SwipeDragRecyclerview
Recycling has always been one of those good things for planet. But the developers took it seriously and brought recycling in the digital world.

Thus, I finally decided to create a demo on it and written a tutorial on [How to Build More Flexible And Efficient Apps With Android RecyclerView Example](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/build-flexible-efficient-app-android-recyclerview-example/).
